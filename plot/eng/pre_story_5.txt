 After half a month of my wanderings around, I managed 
to get acquainted with Vaska, this is the local guard.
  He clearly told what the exam, 
the children of his master wrote this exam.
  He also said that if I have good points, 
I can go to the UNIVERSITY!
  I have not fully understood what it is, but it sounds cool!
  And here are the points! More than 90% I decided correctly!
  Vaska said that there is a cool university in our country.
  Tomsk State University!
  And they just have a receiving campaign now! 
Who do I want to be?
