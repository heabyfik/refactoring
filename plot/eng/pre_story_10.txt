 I've almost finished my second HITS course, 
which means that very soon I will be interviewed 
by IT companies. But I will work not only for me - 
also for my classmates. And for successful 
employment, I need higher rates of study. 

 But the trouble: my classmate Murzik has 
the same grade points as me. We both want to go 
to the same company. We have only one way out...
 
 I should truly show myself and my professional skills. 
(username), will you help me?
