 I’ve almost finished my second HIT course, 
which means that very soon I will be interviewed 
by IT companies. But I will work not only me, 
but also my classmates. And for successful 
employment, I need high rates of study. 

 But the trouble is, my classmate Murzik has 
the same grade points as me. We both want to go 
to the same company, where there is only one place... 
 
 I should truly show myself and my professional skills. 
(username), will you help me help?
