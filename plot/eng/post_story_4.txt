 They are strange. I came to eat, 
and they checked me with a metal detector.
 They asked me to show my pockets. What are the pockets? 
I'm the most ordinary cat!

 But despite this, I was able to solve the problems 
that were given to me.
 They were pretty light. I looked in the box how to 
solve these.

 In fact, I liked that big book that lived with the owner.
 When he opened it and left for tea, I went to bed with her.
 She was very warm and pleasant. But the owner drove 
me every time.

 Therefore, I had to sit next to 
and watch as he cleverly presses the buttons of the book.
