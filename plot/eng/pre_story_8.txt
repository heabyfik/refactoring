 A year has passed. I feel like a cat-scientist
from Pushkin's tale.
 
 Today is good weather, and this is a good excuse
to rest from past deadlines ...

 My friend invited me to walk to the club for cats.
 There you have to be very cool to be able to dance,
otherwise you will have to drink valerian. Wow! 

Let's dance, (username)?
