 Well, I'm now a cat, which has its own free life! 
 One thing is bad... it became boring. 

 Previously, the goal was to wait for the owner. 
 And now, outside the four walls, I feel lonely ... 
 I will go in search for adventures!
 Oh, and who are they? What did he say to me? 

 BARK? I'm sorry, Mister. 
I do not understand your accent ...

 (username), do you understand what they want?
