 Yes, I was wrong. My trials are just beginning. 
 Programmers are those seals who study 
all their life. 
 I must always hold the tail 
with a gun! HITs taught me how to work in a 
team, how to search and analyze. Be one step 
ahead! 

 I wish you, (username), to find your team! 
 Make the right choice! 
 You are a smart cat, I believe in you
